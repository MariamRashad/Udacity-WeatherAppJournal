### Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Programing Languages
* A startup code was provided by Udacity (HTML,CSS, javascript)
* DOM Manipulation occured using JavaScript.
* Creating server occured using node.js

# Installation
* Clone directory and then navigate to root
* Run `npm install` on terminal to download dependencies
* Run `node server.js` to open the server and start the app
* Go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to use the app


#### The starter codes were provided by Udacity. I adjusted the stylesheet by changing the theme and adding animation and hover properties.
